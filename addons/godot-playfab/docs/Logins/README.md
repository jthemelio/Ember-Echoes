# Logins

## Anonymous
The simplest way to get started with PlayFab is to use Anonymous Login.
It allows users to log in without any credentials.
This is particularly useful for quick testing or when you want to provide an experience without requiring
users to create an account.

## Custom ID
Custom ID Login allows users to log in using a custom identifier, with an optional password.
This method is useful when you want to manage user identities yourself, such as using a username or
email address.

## Steam
godot-playfab provides integration with Steam for user authentication.
This allows users to log in using their Steam accounts, leveraging Steam's authentication system.

For more info, refer to the [godot-playfab Steam documentation](../Steam/README.md).
